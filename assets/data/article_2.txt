Pre-emptive oral analgesia with NSAIDs

Preemptive analgesia has been employed for reducing and controlling pain and discomfort in patients postoperatively after periodontal invasive surgical procedures. The term “preemptive" refers to a form of analgesia administered before the onset of pain stimuli to prevent or reduce subsequent pain. Periodontal surgical procedures, including scaling and root planning can cause prolonged intense pain.
The Preemptive Advantage: What the Evidence Says

This systematic review evaluated six randomized controlled trials involving 250 patients undergoing procedures such as flap debridement, mucogingival grafts, and osseous recontouring. Here's the standout insight: medications administered before the pain kicks in significantly reduce postoperative discomfort and reliance on rescue medication.




Pain Reduction Outcomes

Medications like dexamethasone (8 mg), etoricoxib (90 mg and 120 mg), and ketorolac (20 mg) demonstrated superior pain control compared to placebo. These drugs reduced the need for rescue medications and delayed the onset of postoperative pain.
•
Dexamethasone: Effective in reducing pain across various procedures, including mucogingival and flap surgeries. measures.
•
Etoricoxib: Outperformed placebo in controlling pain and demonstrated sustained effects at both 90 mg and 120 mg doses.
•
Ketorolac: Showed notable efficacy in delaying the onset of pain and reducing its intensity.




Clinical Implications

Preventive vs. Reactive: Preemptive analgesia offers an alternative to the traditional "wait-and-treat" approach. By addressing pain pathways early, you improve control over post-op inflammation and discomfort.
Whether you opt for dexamethasone, etoricoxib, or ketorolac, these medications provide a proven pathway to reducing post-op pain.
Patients leave the chair with less pain, fewer medications to manage later, and a much better story to share about their treatment experience.
